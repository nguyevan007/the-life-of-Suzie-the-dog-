<h2>My Favorite Music Genre</h2>
<p>I prefer mostly all songs that are upbeat and alternative music that sets a calm mood. The upbeat music usually makes me more energetic and happy. The alternative music calms me down and makes me reflect on life.</p>
<h2>My Favorite Animal</h2>
<p>My favorite animal would have to be a panda because they are very cute and cuddly. They also spend most of their time eating which is an interesting lifestyle.</p>
<h2>My Favorite Activities</h2>
<p>I enjoy hanging out with my friends and listening to music. I would like to travel to more places when I grow up locally and far away.</p>
